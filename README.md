The [.NET MAUI DataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid) allows you to disable grouping dynamically by clearing the `GroupColumnDescriptions` collection. Additionally, if you want to remove grouping when there's only one group, you can use the following code snippet. The code below illustrates how to dynamically disable grouping for a specific scenario.


 ##### C#
 ```c#
public MainPage()
{
	InitializeComponent();
	viewModel.InstalledModels.CollectionChanged += InstalledModels_CollectionChanged;
}

private void InstalledModels_CollectionChanged(object? sender, System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
	if (e.Action == System.Collections.Specialized.NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add)
	{
		if (datagrid.View!.Groups.Count() == 1)
		{
			datagrid.GroupColumnDescriptions.Clear();
		}
	}
}
 ```
